This repository contains various small Java projects that showcase basic programming concepts and logic. These projects were designed to improve understanding of core Java skills such as loops, conditionals, mathematical operations, and algorithms.
Projects List
1. PI Estimation

    This project uses a simple algorithm to estimate the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method. It simulates random points inside a square and estimates how many fall within a quarter circle to approximate Pi.

2. Population Growth

    A basic program to simulate population growth over a period of time, using a given growth rate and initial population. It outputs the population size at each time interval.

3. Calfing

    This project simulates the number of calves born over several years, taking into account the initial number of cattle, birth rates, and the passing of years.

4. Square

    A program that calculates the area and perimeter of a square based on a user-defined side length.

5. Minimum Value Finder

    This program takes a list of numbers as input and determines the smallest value.

6. Maximum Value Finder

    Similar to the minimum value project, this program finds and outputs the largest number in a list of integers.

7. Averages

    A simple program that calculates the average of a list of numbers. It takes user input and computes the mean.

8. LCM (Least Common Multiple)

    This program calculates the least common multiple of two integers, useful in number theory and for solving problems involving divisibility.

9. Loops Quiz

    A simple interactive quiz to test knowledge of loop structures (for, while, etc.) in Java. It challenges users to solve loop-based problems and provides feedback on their answers.

10. If-Else Examples

    A collection of projects that demonstrate how if-else statements can be used for decision-making, including solving basic problems like checking if a number is even or odd, or determining if a number is prime.
