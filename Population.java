/*(Population projection) The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the
following assumptions:
*1.11
■ One birth every 7 seconds
■ One death every 13 seconds
■ One new immigrant every 45 seconds
1.12
*1.13
Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume the
current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days. Hint: In Java, if two
integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fractional part is truncated. For
example, 5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25) and 10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5). To get an accurate result with
the fractional part, one of the values involved in the division must be a number with a
decimal point. For example, 5.0 / 4 is 1.25 and 10 / 4.0 is 2.5. */
